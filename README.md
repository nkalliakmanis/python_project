In this project we want to create and analyze data. First of all, we created a window of a menu with three options with TKINTER. At the first option we gave numbers and created two equations y=A1x + B1 + R1Rt, where Rt=noise and z=A2y + B2cos(x/T) + R2*Rt and then we save this csv file. In the second option of the window, we loaded this csv file like a Dataframe with PANDAS and we started to analyze our data with NUMPY, SKLEARN and MATPLOTLIB. We made the plot times series, the histograms, the statistics and the correlations of our data that we created. Finally, we used the Linear Regression model and the MLPRegressor to predict the score of our data.
